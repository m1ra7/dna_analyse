# üß¨ DNA Analyse app

# Introduction

This project is a cross-platform health and wellness application built using Flutter and Supabase (as the backend database). While Supabase and Gemini APIs are not actively integrated, the app simulates real data using a pre-defined JSON file and displays it using FutureBuilder.

The application supports iOS, Android, macOS, and Chrome platforms. It includes several modern features such as dynamic app icon switching for Apple devices, light and dark mode support, and localization (l10n) with English and Turkish language options.

The app is designed to provide users with a personalized genetic health overview based on input data, including features such as health risk analysis, nutrition recommendations, fitness guidance, and AI-based assistance.
