# üß¨ DNA Analyse app
# Introduction

This project is a cross-platform DNA analysis application built using Flutter. The application simulates real data using a predefined JSON file and displays it using FutureBuilder.

The app supports iOS, Android, macOS, and Chrome platforms. It includes various modern features such as dynamic app icon changing for Apple devices, light and dark mode support, and localization (l10n) with English and Turkish language options.

The application is designed to provide users with a personalized genetic health overview based on input data, including features such as health risk analysis, nutritional recommendations, fitness guidance, and AI-powered assistance.
