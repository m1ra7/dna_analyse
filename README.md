# üß¨ DNA Analyse app

# Introduction

This application is developed using Flutter as the programming language and Supabase as the database. However, neither Gemini nor Supabase APIs are actively used. Instead, it simulates real data through a locally prepared JSON file and displays it using the FutureBuilder widget.

The app is compatible with iOS, Android, macOS, and Chrome platforms.
It supports dynamic app icon switching on Apple devices and includes both light and dark theme modes.

With l10n (localization) integration, the app supports English and Turkish languages.

The core functionality of the app revolves around providing personalized genetic health analysis, nutritional and fitness insights, and AI-powered health recommendations based on user input.
